dbt project
I have build this project to get the idea of core concepts of  dbt .

In this project I have use trial version of dbt cloud and Snowflake. dbt donâ€™t have its own memory, it needs to use some Datawarehouse to able to execute the queries.

I have created the database and schema named as raw in Snowflake

--sql code --
create database travel_db ;
create Schema raw;


 I have added the two tables -booking_details and customer_details in raw schema
